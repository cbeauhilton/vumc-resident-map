University of Illinois","Med-Peds Hospitalist, Medical Education, Global Health","Jon was born in Virginia Beach, VA, as first generation immigrant. His family has always had an international flair, with his Dutch father, Kenyan stepmother, and Lebanese wife. Jon spent his childhood planning to become president of the United States but decided that politics was not for him after working as an aide in the state capitol during early high school. Thankfully, he switched to medicine and has never looked back. Before pursuing an undergraduate degree, he volunteered for a non-profit organization doing community development in Costa Rica, the Philippines, and Indonesia. Later, he earned his Bachelors of Science in chemistry at Wheaton College, where he also met his wife, Olivia. Following his undergraduate education, he worked for one year in the chemical industry (where he literally had to watch paint dry as part of his job description). He then attended medical school at University of Illinois and discovered Med-Peds. Jon and Olivia are both passionate about global health and correcting health disparities in developing countries. Specifically, Jon would like to build residency programs in developing countries in order to contribute to a self-sustaining global physician workforce. When Jon is not learning medicine you might find him running a 5k, reading the Economist or a book on space exploration, cooking ethnic Lebanese food with his wife, or enjoying a glass of Californian cabernet sauvignon or Italian barbera.
